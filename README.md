# Breast Cancer Gene Analysis

This repository contains code when I worked in <a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/melissa-troester-phd/">Dr. Melissa Troester</a>'s lab in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Since part of my work contains confidential materials from the lab, this repository will only include functions written by myself.

* Data_Cleaning_Function: clean and organize raw data produced from nSolver, and derive lab-specific flags for further analysis
* RUV_PCA_Function: RUVg function that provides PCA plot of designated K value
